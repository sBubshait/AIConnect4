# AIConnect4
The famous Connect4 game, but it is you against AI this time!

# Notes:
1. If the human player go first, it is not guaranteed that the AI player will win (for any algorithm).
2. This is improved than the previous Tic-Tac-Toe AI player as this uses Alpha-beta purning which helps reduce the calculations required.
3. However, it still only consider the next 5 steps. This is because as the depth increases, the computations requried increases exponentially and so is time needed. This should be great enough, yet a win is not guaranteed.
